# UEGaussianSplatting (WIP)

> Still Work In Progress! Not Done Yet!

## Overview
Loading and rendering highly detailed large scale assets in 3D software is always a big challenge.
Unreal Engine has the feature like Nanite for handling high poly/large scale mesh.
However, currently there isn't any solution for handling high density/large scale gaussian splats.
This project primarily aims to solve this issue though dynamic streaming methods.

## Temporary Result
- 1 million gaussian splats in 120 fps

- Nanite-like gaussin splatting performance optimization solution

## To Do List
- [x] Import, process PLY file and save as uasset
- [x] Render splats at given postiion
- [x] Add efficient sorting algorith: Radix Sort
- [x] Render color and alpha blending
- [x] Hook render result into Unreal Engine's render pipeline: before post process
- [x] Speed up serialize and deserialize process: Bulk Data
- [x] Hierarchical Data Structure: Cluster + LOD
- [ ] Dynamic switching micro LOD
- [ ] Dynamic load and unload macro tiles
- [ ] Anti Aliasing

## How To Use It
- Simply press the import button to import PLY file

- Add Gaussian Splat Actor to the level

- Assign the imported PLY uasset to the Gaussian Splat Actor

## Debug Console Command
- `gs.ShowClusterBounds 1`: enable Nanite cluster preview
- `gs.UseLODRendering 1`: enable Nanite cluster render
